## üî® Project features

Developed with the powerful NextJS framework, on one page, you have access to all second generation pok√©mon, bringing the details of a pok√©mon's attributes by clicking on "details". A Pokedex is an electronic device featured in the Pok√©mon game and anime series that serves as a digital encyclopedia for all known species of Pok√©mon. It contains detailed information about each Pok√©mon, such as its name, number in registration order, type, abilities, battle statistics, possible evolutions, where it can be found, and other resources. In this interpretation, you can see your number, pok√©mon types, weight and height!

## üìö More tutorial information

PokeNext is an application for pokemons consultation, developed from the tutorial [Matheus Battisti](https://www.youtube.com/@MatheusBattisti).
The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis tutorial implementation is to learn and develop the concepts of the nextjs framework, one of the current darlings in the market. The format of working with modular CSS is interesting, as css overlapping problems are stipulated. Individual item access is also different. I conclude that nextJs and SSR can be powerful, but needs to be trained a lot, especially when migrating. It resembles the react query.
